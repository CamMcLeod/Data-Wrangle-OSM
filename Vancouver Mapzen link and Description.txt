Vancouver is a coastal city in the south-western corner of Canada. Vancouver is a seaport best known for its popularity as a Hollywood filming location, and its proximity to both mountains and the ocean. Vancouver was also the host of the 2010 Winter Olympic games.

I chose Vancouver because it is the city where UBC, the school where I took my undergraduate degree, is located.
